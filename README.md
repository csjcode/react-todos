React TODOs Demo - setup and ideas 
====

Use this as a starting point for: [Build Web Apps with React JS and Flux](https://www.udemy.com/learn-and-understand-reactjs/) course on Udemy.com.

###Getting Started###
The basics of getting started were supplied by a build and instruction from the Udemy teacher Stephen Grider in his React class. I'm getting the basics down here and then building in some more options later.

```
	> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactStarter.git
	> cd ReactStarter
	> npm install
	> gulp
```
